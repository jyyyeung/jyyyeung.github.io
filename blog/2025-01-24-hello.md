# Hello World

Celebrating the birth of my website. 

<!-- truncate -->

## Website Information 

- This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
- The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jyyyeung/jyyyeung.github.io).
- The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Initialization Steps 

I like to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to initialize the project. 

```bash
pnpm create docusaurus
```

It will ask you a few questions to initialize the project. 

- Name of the site: `jyyyeung.github.io`
- Choose the default theme of Docusaurus (selection): `classic`
- JavaScript or TypeScript (selection): `TypeScript`

This will create a new directory called `jyyyeung.github.io` and install the necessary dependencies. 

Then, I pushed the project to GitHub. 

Done.
