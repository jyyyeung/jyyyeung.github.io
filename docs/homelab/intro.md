# ZSLab Wiki

This is the homepage of my Home Lab (ZSLab). This wiki was born because I want to have a better documentation of my home lab, and to share my knowledge with others.

:::tip

Note that this wiki will never be "up to date", as I am constantly playing with new toys and changing the way I do things.

## üìñ Table of Contents

- [Hardware](./hardware/intro)
- [VMs](./vm/intro)
- [Docker](./docker/intro)

## üåü The beginning 

It all started with "I want to backup my photos", so I bought a Synology DS920+.

## üåê Networking 

For hardware used, see [Hardware](./hardware/intro).

### Software 

The home network uses a soft router running [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) and a [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) server for virtualization. Within OPNsense, I run [AdGuard](https://adguardhome.org/) as a network filter and [Unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) as a DNS server. On the same machine, I run [Omada Controller](https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/omada-sdn-controller/) as an SDN controller for my wired network. 

### VLANs 

VLANs are defined in OPNsense and used to separate the network into different zones.

### Intrusion Detection 

<!-- TODO: Update this -->
[Suricata](https://suricata.io/) is used to detect intrusions and anomalies.

## üîí Security 

### Traefik 

Traefik allows me easily access applications on the internal network through my registered domain name.

### Tailscale 

Tailscale connects all the devices in my home lab and allows me to access them from anywhere.

### Cloudflare 

Cloudflare protects my home lab from the outside world.

### OAuth 2.0

OAuth is connected to Traefik to force authentication for specific applications.


## ü§ñ Automation Through Ansible 

I use Ansible to automate the setup of my home lab. They are managed on GitHub.
