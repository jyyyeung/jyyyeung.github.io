# YY Home Lab Wiki

This is the homepage of my Home Lab Wiki.
This Wiki is written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and published using [Flowershow](https://flowershow.app/). Some setup information can be found [[Flowershow Setup|here]].

This wiki was born because I want to have a better documentation of my home lab.
